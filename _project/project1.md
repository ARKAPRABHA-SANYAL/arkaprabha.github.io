INCOXPENSE - Income-Expense Application

[INCOXPENSE](https://github.com/ARKAPRABHA-SANYAL/incoxpense) is an innovative income-expense application that I developed using Django on the backend, complemented by HTML, JavaScript, and a MySQL database. With a secure email authentication login system, it offers a seamless user experience for managing financial transactions.

Key Features:
- Secure login system with email authentication.
- Comprehensive CRUD functionality for income and expense management.
- Real-time tracking of monthly savings based on income and expenses.
- AJAX-powered search feature for efficient data filtering.
- Support for multiple currency options.
- Interactive 6-month data visualization using chart.js for improved financial insight.
- Integration of Django admin page for easy management.

INCOXPENSE simplifies financial management by providing a user-friendly interface for tracking income, expenses, and savings. Whether you're an individual or a business, INCOXPENSE empowers you to take control of your financial journey.
