Welcome to my website!

I am an undergraduate at the 
[Department of Electrical Engineering, Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=58). I am currently in the 4th year of my B.E. degree. I am Passionate about Fullstack Development as well as Database Management where I've worked on handling and retrieving data through two of my projects INCOXPENSE and WANDERLY
where I have worked on managing the frontend, backend as well as inserting, deletion, updating and retrieving data from the database. My application also has a simplified visualisation of data using chart.js. Feel free to take a look at my projects and CV page for more details.

Apart from this, I have solved several questions on Data Structures and Algorithms as well as on databases in Leetcode and codeforces. I also  like to solve problems based on quantitative aptitude, Data Interpretation and puzzles.

Apart from studies I have great enthusiasm for Playing as well as watching football matches and analysing the game details.
